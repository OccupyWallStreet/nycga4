== How to Set Up The Plugin Defaults ==

If you don't want to specify all the settings for every Flickr slideshow or gallery you can set up some defaults. The default value is used when you have not specified a value on the individual slideshow, gallery or galleria. All the following settings are optional; we only strongly recommend you set the Flickr ID to save having to set it on every use of the plugin.

* Go to the "Settings" section, and choose "Slickr Flickr"
* Enter your Flickr Id (the ID is of the form 12345678@N00) and choose whether it is a user or group id
* Enter your Flickr API Key (optional)
