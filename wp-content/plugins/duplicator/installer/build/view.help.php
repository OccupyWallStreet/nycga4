		<b>Action:</b><br/>
		'Create New' will attempt to create a new database if it does not exist.  This option will not work on many hosting providers.  If the database does not exist then you will need to login to your control panel and create the database.  If 'Connect and Remove All Data' is checked this will DELETE all tables in the database you are connecting to as the Duplicator requires a blank database.  Please make sure you have backups of all your data before using an portion of the installer, as this option WILL remove all data.  Please contact your server administrator for more details.
		<br/><br/>

		<b>Host:</b><br/>
		The name of the host server that the database resides on.  Many times this will be localhost, however each hosting provider will have it's own naming convention please check with your server administrator.
		<br/><br/>

		<b>User:</b><br/>
		The name of a MySQL database server user. This is special account that has privileges to access a database and can read from or write to that database.  <i style='font-size:11px'>This is <b>not</b> the same thing as your WordPress administrator account</i>

		<br/><br/>		

		<b>Enforce SSL on Admin:</b><br/>

		<br/><br/>	

		<b>Enforce SSL on Login:</b><br/>
		Turn off SSL support for WordPress Logins. This sets FORCE_SSL_LOGIN in your wp-config file to false if true, otherwise it will create the setting if not set.

<h3>Step 2 - Update</h3>
<div id="dup-help-step1" class="dup-help-page">

	<!-- SETTINGS-->
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Settings</b></legend>
		<b>Old Settings:</b><br/>
		The URL and Path settings are the original values that the package was created with.  These values should not be changed.
		<br/><br/>

		<b>New Settings:</b><br/>
		These are the new values (URL, Path and Title) you can update for the new location at which your site will be installed at.
		<br/>		
	</fieldset>

	<!-- NEW ADMIN ACCOUNT-->
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>New Admin Account</b></legend>

		<br/>		
	</fieldset>

	<!-- ADVANCED OPTS -->
	<fieldset>
		<legend><b>Advanced Options</b></legend>
		<b>Site URL:</b><br/>
		For details see WordPress <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_The_Site_URL" target="_blank">Site URL</a> &amp; <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Giving_WordPress_Its_Own_Directory" target="_blank">Alternate Directory</a>.  If you're not sure about this value then leave it the same as the new settings URL.
		<br/><br/>

		<b>Scan Tables:</b><br/>

		If your moving a site keep this value checked. For more details see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_The_Site_URL#Important_GUID_Note" target="_blank">notes on GUIDS</a>.	Changing values in the posts table GUID column can change RSS readers to evaluate that the posts are new and may show them in feeds again.		
		<br/><br/>	
		
		<b>Full Search:</b><br/>
		Full search forces a scan of every single cell in the database. If it is not checked then only text based columns are searched which makes the update process much faster.
