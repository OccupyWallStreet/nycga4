The Taxonomy List Shortcode plugin adds a shortcode to your WordPress installation which enables you to display multiple unordered lists containing every term of a given taxonomy.

==Description==
The Taxonomy List Shortcode plugin adds a [shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) to your [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) installation which enables you to display multiple unordered lists containing every term of a given [taxonomy](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Taxonomy ).


__Usage__
Adding `[taxonomy-list]` to your post content will render a set of three unordered lists containing all terms of a given taxonomy. Custom css will be printed in a style tag to the head of every page view. If this is unacceptable to you, you may turn it off by using the checkbox labeled "Enable CSS" under the "Taxonomy" section of "Settings" in the Administration Panels.

__Supported Parameters__

1. __tax__ To define the taxonomy that you would like to list terms from, you will need to specifiy the name of the taxonomy in the `tax` parameter: `[taxonomy-list tax="category"]`. In an "out-of-the-box" installation of WordPress, the following taxonomies will be recognized: `post_tag`, `category`, and `link_category`. If you have defined custom taxonomies through use of a plugin or your own hacker-skillz, you can use the name of this taonomy as well: `[taxonomy-list tax="fishy-squiggles"]`. If the taxonomy cannot be located, due to a spelling error or missing code, the `[taxonomy-list]` shortcode will return an empty string.

1. __cols__ To define the number of columns that the `[taxonomy-list]` shortcode generates, you will want to use the `cols` parameter. This parameter will accept an integer from 1 - 5. If this parameter is left empty, or a value outside of it's range is defined, it will default to three columns. Example: `[taxonomy-list tax="category" cols="4"]`.

1. __color__ Use this to define the color of the text. The color passed should be in hexidecimal notation (ff0000) or short hand (f00) Please do not include the hash character (#).

1. __background__ Use this to define the color of the background. The color passed should be in hexidecimal notation (ff0000) or short hand (f00) Please do not include the hash character (#).

1. __show_counts__ (bool) If you would like to disable the counts from displaying after your term name, set this parameter to `0`. Default value is `1`.

1. __NEW! per_page__ (int) Using this parameter enables paging for your term list. It accepts a numerical value from 1 to "your hearts desire". It is suggested that this feature only be activated on pages that display a list of terms from a single taxonomy. No need to worry, if you have 2 or more lists of terms on a page and you add the per_page parameter to both shortcodes, your site will not break. Please refrain from using this parameter on shortcodes within posts.

__Examples__

1. __Post Tags (default)__ `[taxonomy-list]` - Display a three column, list of Post Tags in alphetbetical order. Although this is the default usage, it is synonymous with `[taxonomy-list tax="post_tag" cols="3"]`.

1. __Post Categories__ `[taxonomy-list tax='category']` - Display a three column, unordered list of Post Categories.

1. __Link Categories__ `[taxonomy-list tax='link_category']` - Display a three column, unordered list of Link Categories. Special note: it is rather pointless to use link categories do to the fact that WordPress does not support front-end display of individual links.

1. __Custom Taxonomy__ `[taxonomy-list tax="fishy-squiggles"]` - Display a three column, unordered list of the [custom taxonomy](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2009/05/06/custom-taxonomies-in-wordpress-28) "fishy-squiggles".

1. __Two Columns__ `[taxonomy-list cols="2"]` - Display a two, horizontally-aligned unordered lists of Post Tags.

1. __Five Columns (maximum)__ `[taxonomy-list cols="5"]` - Display a 5, horizontally-aligned unordered lists of Post Tags.

1. __Custom Taxonomy with 5 Columns__ `[taxonomy-list tax="fishy-squiggles" cols="5"]` - Display 5, horizontally-aligned unordered lists of the custom taxonomy "fishy-squiggles".

__Notes on post status__

* Terms containing published, password protected posts will be shown in the list.
* Terms containing only private, scheduled, draft or posts pending review will not be displayed in the list.
